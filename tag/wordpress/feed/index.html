										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Every now and then I was having issues with my WordPress on Linux App Service gallery application I had gotten from the Azure Marketplace. My plugins would disappear, my themes would break, and all my pictures would disappear. This article is to help users with issues like this, showing how to fix persistence issues for WordPress on Linux Azure App Services.</p>
<h2>Explanation of Behavior</h2>
<p>The reason that this issue occurs is due to the fact that the files are not persisted on the file system after restarts, moved to another worker, or other web app maintenance that Azure&#8217;s master node deems to be suitable for the web app. This makes it so that once there is maintenance on the web app, the cached data isn&#8217;t moved over properly. The posts are kept because they are stored on a SQL database (from my understanding).</p>
<h2>Navigating to Kudu</h2>
<p>Before configuring the web app to persist data, first you have to make sure that you backup your current WordPress site. This is because the setting you are going to change is going to wipe the web app and remove all WordPress content.</p>
<blockquote><p>Before backing up your site, make sure that you have all the plugins, etc&#8230; installed.</p></blockquote>
<p>In order to backup your current WordPress site, you&#8217;ll have to open Kudu on the WordPress application.<br />
Kudu is a sort of dashboard to debug and connect to your app service. For more information on Kudu you can take a look at these links :<br />
<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/videos/what-is-kudu-with-david-ebbo/">Video on Using Kudu From Microsoft</a><br />
That being said, in order to access application&#8217;s Kudu please navigate to your app service &gt; advanced tools &gt; go.<br />
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Yor6IWP.png" /><br />
This will bring you to the Kudu dashboard. From there, go to Debug Console &gt; SSH.<br />
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/KgZVzJA.png" /></p>
<h2>Backing Up Your App Service</h2>
<p>Now that we are in Kudu&#8217;s SSH console, we can start backing up the app service&#8217;s data. In the SSH Console run the following commands:<br />
[code language=&#8221;powershell&#8221;]<br />
cd /home/site/wwwroot<br />
apk update<br />
apk add zip<br />
apk add ncftp<br />
zip -r wwwroot.zip .<br />
[/code]<br />
Here we are basically going to the wwwroot for your wordpress site, and zipping up everything on the app service and putting it in the wwwroot directory.<br />
Now that we have created a backup of our WordPress site, we still need to put it into our App Service deployment code. In order to do this, first we will need to get the username, password, and FTP site from the publish profile. To get the publish profile, go to your app service and press &#8220;Get Publish Profile&#8221; in the Azure portal.<br />
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gfNwqMp.png" /><br />
Now go back to the SSH console that you got to through Kudu. Now use the code below, replacing YourUsername and YourFTPURL with your respective information retrieved from the Publish Profile :<br />
[code language=&#8221;powershell&#8221;]<br />
ncftp -u &#8216;YourUsername\$YourUsername&#8217; &lt;a href=&quot;ftp://waws-prod-bay-081.ftp.azurewebsites.windows.net&quot;&gt;ftp://YourFTPUrlÂ &lt;/a&gt;site<br />
[/code]<br />
Enter your password, and then use the commands :<br />
[code language=&#8221;powershell&#8221;]<br />
cd site/wwwroot<br />
put wwwroot.zip<br />
[/code]<br />
Now you should have successfully backed up your app service.</p>
<h2>Configuring App Service to Persist</h2>
<blockquote><p>Note: Please make sure that you have backed up your app service properly. If you aren&#8217;t sure, please make sure to copy the content on your wordpress blog and back it up. This process is going to wipe your currently deployed app service.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now that we have backed up our app service. We will have to configure our App Service to properly cache your data. In order to do this go to your app service&#8217;s app settings and simply configure the websites_enable_app_service_storage from false to true.<br />
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/bXYT4OK.png" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Now that we have configured this to true, save it.</p>
<h2>Restoring Your App Service</h2>
<p>This will now wipe your app service. Now when you go to your website now and it shows a default app service page. This is normal.<br />
Reopen your Kudu SSH console, and unzip the file you zipped in the backup stage into your app service.<br />
[code language=&#8221;powershell&#8221;]<br />
unzip wwwroot.zip<br />
[/code]<br />
You have now restored the App Service and it will look like it used to.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We have gone through connecting to Kudu, backing up your app service, configuring your app service for persistence, and restoring your app service. Now your WordPress should be ready to go and your plugins won&#8217;t disappear again. If you have anymore questions feel free to post a comment or to open a support ticket with Azure, one of Microsoft&#8217;s Support Engineers will reach out to you to resolve the issue as soon as possible.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This post is a short guide on How to use the Frost Po.et Plugin to help new users of the frost plugin for po.et to get up and running. We will start from the WordPress wp-admin dashboard install our po.et plugin, get the key, and utilize the po.et plugin in a post.</p>
<blockquote><p>Note: As time moves on things will change. For that sake please keep in mind the versioning. I am using <strong>WordPress 4.9.5</strong> and the <strong><a href="https://blog.po.et/announcing-frost-an-open-api-for-publishers-a16addbd4bdd">po.et plugin</a> is version 1.0.1</strong> as of 6/19/18. If you are using a different versioning your mileage may vary. Please comment if your version is different and I may be able to help.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Installing the Po.et Plugin</h2>
<p>In order to install the po.et plugin, from the wp-admin dashboard, go to the plugins section on the left-hand side and hover over <em>plugins</em>, and then go toÂ <em>add new</em>.</p>
<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="DVnlCNq"><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br />
From there, we will see the plugins marketplace. In the search bar highlighted below on the right side of the panel, please look up po.et. You should then be able to see the plugin po.et with the feather. I have already installed this item, but if you haven&#8217;t you would see an install button, press the install button and you should have po.et on your WordPress site now.</p>
<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="TPPUALq"><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Configuring Frost for Your Plugin</h2>
<p>After installing the po.et application, we are going to want to configure the plugin to be able to work on the po.et test-net. In order to do this, you will have to get a key that will identify you as a user of po.et. In order to get the key please go to <a href="https://frost.po.et">https://frost.po.et</a></p>
<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="5TRpoeo"><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br />
There, you will want to sign up for Frost clicking on the green button on the top right of the website.</p>
<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="qrDmsWl"><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br />
After signing up, you will be able to reach the frost dashboard which will look like the picture below. From here, please click on API Keys.</p>
<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="MTbueB3"><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br />
After clicking on getting API key, you will have to press get API key again. The first click will not automatically generate one, here I have already created one by press the second get API key highlighted below.</p>
<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="Cw3W6eQ"><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br />
Now that we have an API key, click on it to copy it your clipboard.</p>
<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="07s7WaT"><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Configuring Plugin to Utilize Frost Information</h2>
<p>Once we have copied it, you will want to go back to your WordPress dashboard, and hover over the plugins section again and click on installed plugins.</p>
<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="2KJbutA"><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br />
Now we should see all our installed plugins, you may have to scroll or search for it if you have many plugins.</p>
<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="RHebkdM"><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br />
Here it&#8217;s my fourth plugin. After finding it, click the settings button highlighted in the picture above.<br />
Now you will be able to see the configurations of the Po.et plugin API.</p>
<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="Qw86g3d"><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br />
Paste the API key we copied from the Frost dashboard into the API token area in the poet configurations. In addition, you will have to fill out the Author Name. The Author name is arbitrary and you can utilize whatever author name you would like. Make sure that the API URL is https://api.frost.po.et/works, and that post articles automatically on insert or update are activated. Then press saves changes.Â  Now you have successfully configured the po.et plugin!</p>
<h2>Using the Po.et Plugin in a Post</h2>
<p>Now that we have installed it, we can utilize WordPress&#8217; shortcode feature to install po.et into our posts. You can do this by putting in the shortcode [[poet-badge]] . I put this poet-badge shortcode here by putting another set of brackets around it as shown in the picture below. Wherever you put the [[poet-badge]] shortcode without the extra brackets is where the poetstamp will be shown. So as shown in the picture below the shortcode will display the stamp below the conclusion section.</p>
<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="JjrKZFl"><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br />
&nbsp;<br />
This shortcode will timestamp your posts and send it to the test-net utilizing the API key to the API endpoint (The API URL). This will then put it on the blockchain. You can see the badge in action at the bottom of this WordPress post.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>We have installed, configured, and utilize the po.et plugin in our post. By utilizing the shortcode we are able to put the po.et timestamp in our WordPress posts and be able to properly track our content. If there are any questions or issues please comment on this and I will get back to you as soon as possible.<br />
