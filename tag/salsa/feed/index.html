										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This is an easy 10 minute Microwave Breakfast for under 2$ that you can cook at the office. This is a great quick microwave breakfast in the office.<br />
I like to minimize my time with breakfast but cereal, muffins, and other quick fixes are unhealthy, expensive, and leave an over processed taste in my mouth over time. So I&#8217;ve evolved my breakfast routine to some healthier foods and for cost efficiency and time I have made it so that it takes about 5 minutes of actual work to get a healthy tasty meal at work.<br />
I utilize a modified version of the Tim Ferriss, back when he seemed a bit more awkward on camera.<br />
Linked to it is below,<br />
<iframe title="How to Make A Healthy Breakfast In Under 3 Minutes" width="1080" height="608" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fd-7a_wdVZk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
Unfortunately it&#8217;s not very easy to find this recipe in text form, so I had to watch the whole video. I know I&#8217;d rather read compressed material than watch a video and try to extract the information.<br />
Nonetheless he had some great ideas obviously and now is kicking it with famous people on his new podcast. I&#8217;m going to spare you the 6 minutes and give you a quick run down of the recipe.</p>
<h1>Quick Microwave Breakfast in the Office</h1>
<h2><strong>Hardware Requirements (Initial cost of ~$20-40)</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Microwave (20$ for a cheap microwave at in store at Kroger, I&#8217;ve noticed that online ones are quite expensive a quick search got a cheap 23$ one at a Sears outlet, and 36$ for a Hamilton beach at walmart)</li>
<li>Microwavable Container (5-10$ one time purchase)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Time Cost: About 10-20 minutes searching online. 30-50 minutes going into store to purchase one.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Material Requirements ($2.33 &#8211; $4.00)</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Liquid Egg Whites ($3.50 for about 16oz, I use about $0.50~$0.80 cents worth of it each time)</li>
<li>SalsaÂ  [you can pick whichever salsa, keep it in context of a meal of egg whites and other breakfasts my favorite is mango salsa which funnily sounds horrible on chips] (~$3.00 for ~16oz, and I use about 1/6 ea time so about $0.5)</li>
<li>Frozen Chopped Spinach (I buy mine at Whole Foods for $2.00, and I use about 1/5 the container each time so about $0.40)</li>
<li>Salt and Pepper (free~1$)</li>
<li>Frozen fruit or Fresh fruit depending on your budget, location, and convenience ($1-4, I like to buy a decently size box of sliced mango at El Ranchero for about $3.00 for convenience. I eat about 1/3 of it so I&#8217;m pricing this at $1 personally. But you could easily buy cheaper fruit some healthy cheap fruits are listed <a href="https://greatist.com/health/44-healthy-foods-under-1">here</a> the cheapest being grapes and oranges for about $0.5 each)</li>
<li>Coffee/Tea (free ~$0.33-$1.00)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Time Cost : 5-10minutes of cooking and prep time.</strong><br />
<em>Nice to haves : Salsa con Queso to put on your spinach ($3.00 it makes it super good)</em><br />
&nbsp;<br />
So for about 2-3$ for each breakfast and about 10-15 minutes you can get a large filling healthy breakfast at work. Most work places have Microwaves so this is really most convenient if you already have one. Once you have these items together below are the steps I follow:</p>
<h1>Directions</h1>
<p>I use a 12 oz cup and pour half to 3/4 of the cup of liquid egg whites. Then I put the cup into the microwave for 2 minutes and 30 seconds.<br />
During the time it&#8217;s cooking I pour some frozen spinach into another 12oz cup and then follow the directions and pour a bit of water onto the frozen spinach. I pour about enough to fill up the 12oz cup as it will thaw and fill up half the cup once cooked.<br />
Once finished, the egg whites should be cooked; take it out, and put the frozen spinach into the Microwave. Then microwave the frozen spinach for about 1.5 minutes.<br />
While the frozen spinach is cooking, I put my egg whites onto a paper plate, throw some salt and pepper on it, and then pour my salsa over the egg whites.<br />
Once the frozen spinach has microwaved for 1.5 minutes, take it out, pour out the water, and then put it back into the Microwave for 2 minutes.<br />
At this point I&#8217;ll get the fruit ready, you will need to microwave respectively the frozen fruit you have. I personally love my sliced mango and I can just take it out and put it next to my egg whites.<br />
Once the Spinach is finished cooking, I put it out on my plate. If you have decided to go down the salsa con queso route, you&#8217;ll have to microwave the salsa con queso for about 0:15-0:30 seconds and then pour it on your spinach. (You won&#8217;t regret it)<br />
I also have coffee or tea with my breakfast, luckily I have free coffee and tea and just grab some.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>I&#8217;m also lucky and where I work they have disposable paper cups and plates that I can microwave stuff in so I personally use that stuff and throw it all out once I&#8217;m done making it so that I don&#8217;t have to clean anything.<br />
You can use microwavable plastic, but personally I would not microwave stuff in plastic. I believe there is no proof saying that microwaving plastic will cause cancer but practice at your own risk.<br />
