										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Soylent After a Month is quite an experience. This post is to review my time with only using Soylent over the course of a month. I was using a mixture of bagged Soylent and premixed. This was while the bagged Soylent was on V1.7.<br />
In addition to this, I&#8217;d like to note that purchasing Soylent straight from the website is cheaper than buying it on Amazon. I highly suggest going to Soylent.com in order to purchase your product.<br />
If you use my referral link below, you can get the first order of 12 soylent bottles for 50% off! It&#8217;s worth trying for 50% off. In addition to that, they will donate 1$ to world hunger :<br />
<a href="http://r.soy.lt/jUm8Z">http://r.soy.lt/jUm8Z</a></p>
<h2>Inventory</h2>
<p><em>Ordered 12/15/16 from <a href="https://soylent.com/">www.soylent.com</a></em></p>
<ul>
<li>6 x 12 Soylent Originals (72 bottles or 14.4 days of original)</li>
<li>3 x 12 Coffiest Soylent (C1-00CFE) (36 bottles or 7.2 days of Coffiest)</li>
<li>9 Bags of Soylent (9 Days)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pros</h2>
<p>Convenience, Speed, Don&#8217;t have to cook or order out, No need to wonder what to eat next, time-saving</p>
<h2>Cons</h2>
<p>Price, Taste, Makes you feel like a robot, off-putting at first drinking only Soylent, No chewing/eating food makes your jaws lose strength, not being able to eat with others</p>
<h2>A Summary of my Experience</h2>
<p>At first, it&#8217;s a bit scary drinking only liquid over the course of 30 days. Because it&#8217;s so different you really have to get used to drinking the soylent mentally. Physically, it&#8217;s actually quite nice since you don&#8217;t have to figure out what you want to eat, cook it, go out to buy the food/ingredients, and etc&#8230;<br />
The convenience of soylent is amazing. Simply order a month of Soylent, it gets delivered to your house. Then you&#8217;re done, you have a month supply of food in your living room. If you&#8217;re hungry all you have to do is walk over and grab a bottle. It&#8217;s sort of like the convenience factor of having to wear a uniform to school. You never really have to worry about what to wear, all you have to do is get your uniform and go. It simplifies things, and I really didn&#8217;t even miss eating food. It truly is a game changer and opens up your life to do so many more things with that saved time.<br />
That being said, you have to get adjusted to drinking only liquid for food. Only consuming liquid for sustenance can be really off-putting at first. Honestly, after a while, you&#8217;ll start to feel like a robot getting your daily gas for the day. But Soylent really changes things. Since you are consuming the optimal amount of calories/nutrients, you don&#8217;t overeat or undereat anymore. You don&#8217;t have to worry about whether you are getting all your nutrients as long as you&#8217;re consuming your five bottles of Soylent a day.<br />
An interesting side effect of only drinking soylent was that my jaws started to feel sore after I talked for too long. I didn&#8217;t really notice this at first but I realized because I wasn&#8217;t chewing food anymore I wasn&#8217;t really using my jaws much anymore. This might have been a placebo, but I had to start chewing a bit of gum to fight off the soreness and recessed jaw muscles.<br />
Another issue with Soylent that some people have is that they aren&#8217;t able to eat food with other people. Personally, it wasn&#8217;t a super big deal. I don&#8217;t mind sitting with others drinking water or something, to be honest. It&#8217;s not an awkward experience for me at all, most of the time people are on their phones anyways at some point in time, so I&#8217;d just scroll through Reddit or try to do something more productive with my time.</p>
<h2>Key Experience</h2>
<p>An extremely important experience regarding my bottled soylent experience was that I felt the best I had ever felt IN MY LIFE. I used to feel bloated or uncomfortable if I ate something bad. But I never felt bloated while on Soylent. Also, when you&#8217;re hungry it&#8217;s very easy to resolve the hunger quickly. All you would have to do is go to the soylent storage and grab a bottle and then, you&#8217;re not hungry anymore. I lost some weight, and I felt super light. I truly loved drinking Soylent because of this, and I was playing a lot of League of Legends during this time, so I could easily drink my meal between loading screens.<br />
I felt so efficient, however, when you are continuously playing league of legends on hours, you get this special type of fatigue that I personally had never experienced before. Usually, you will have to take a break to eat food, but I never took a break. So I just kept going, and this made me so tired! It was a very interesting experience for me as I had never felt this kind of fatigue before! Even two years later, I remember this fatigue like yesterday and it truly was an experience to be had.</p>
<h2>Bottled Soylent vs Packaged Powder Soylent</h2>
<p>The bottled soylent was MUCH MUCH better than the packaged powder soylent. Honestly, the powdered soylent was NOT convenient, mixing Soylent at V1.7 was extremely bad. The powder didn&#8217;t mix well with water and you really needed a blender to properly mix the soylent. not to mention, you have to clean the bottles. And if you didn&#8217;t clean the bottles IMMEDIATELY, the bottles will start to smell horrific. I have no idea what that smell was but it got so bad, I had to start cleaning everything immediately after mixing the soylent up.<br />
That being said, the bottled soylent was great. I personally really enjoyed the taste. It was like a slight vanilla flavored taste of Soylent and I honestly liked it. The powder soylent, no matter what I did, never would taste close to what the bottled tasted like. I tried multiple levels of mixture, but there was no way it would taste like whatever they do for the bottled soylent.</p>
<h2>Overall</h2>
<p>I would highly suggest trying Soylent if you haven&#8217;t. I personally would have continued to drink bottled Soylent if it wasn&#8217;t so expensive. I have gone back to regular food but sometime substitute some breakfasts with Coffiest because of how convenient it is. But purchasing foods is actually cheaper than Soylent, so it&#8217;s hard to justify actually drinking Soylent 5 times a day. I hope that they are able to drive the price down, and one day it&#8217;ll be cheaper to actually drink Soylent than to buy food. I&#8217;ll be for sure one of the guys who makes the switch ASAP once it&#8217;s reached that inflection point as I did truly enjoy my experience drinking Soylent.<br />
