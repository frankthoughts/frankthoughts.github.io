										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This is a review on the Plantronics Blackwire C725, a solid headset that can be bought off of Newegg for about 130$. I would say overall that this headset is not worth the money and will go into some of the pros and cons of the headset below. This headset MSRPs for 170$.</p>
<h1>Design and Out of Box Experience</h1>
<p>The design is like a budget headset, it comes in a blank cardboard box and has no bells and whistles.<br />
<img src="https://www.plantronics.com/content/dam/plantronics/products/blackwire/blackwire-725.png.transform/hero-image/img.png" alt="Blackwire 725 Standard" /><br />
In the box it comes with:</p>
<ul>
<li>USB headset</li>
<li>Cloth Bag</li>
</ul>
<p>Needless to say, this headset packaging is very utility. That being said does the sound quality of this headset make up for the lack of bells and whistles and lackluster design?</p>
<h1>General Overview</h1>
<p>In response to the last question, these headphones do not live up to the lackluster design and price tag. The sound is very mediocre, and for the price is almost kind of ridiculous. In addition to that this headset&#8217;s microphone will rub up against your cheek making it so that you have to push the left ear up a little bit in order to avoid rubbing the mic. I feel like overall there are so many flaws and poor design issues that this headset&#8217;s 170$ MSRP price tag blows my mind. This headset was obviously designed for a company that receives a discount on these poor headsets.<br />
These headphones do come with Automatic Noise Canceling so that when you put them on, they&#8217;re supposed to noise cancel. In general, the comfort is decent for letting you be able to wear these headphones for 5+ hours without any issues.</p>
<h1>Sound Quality</h1>
<p>The sound quality of these headphones wasn&#8217;t anything extravagant. Compared to most headsets of this caliber the C725 doesn&#8217;t match them at all. However, I haven&#8217;t experienced any points in time where I am actively conscience of the lackluster of sound. It does its job as a pair of office headphones.<br />
If you&#8217;re looking for a headset for quality with a microphone I personally suggest the Plantronics Voyager Focus UC, these headphones for a bit more money are overall better with a microphone not to mention the other features.</p>
<h1>Microphone Quality</h1>
<p>The Microphone Quality on this pair of headphones is borderline bad as said, in the beginning, the microphone will rub up against your cheek. This headset when trying to talk to someone on skype will continue to make a rubbing sound into the microphone since it&#8217;s so close to the cheek.Â  You aren&#8217;t able to bend it either so you&#8217;re stuck with the microphone stuck close to your face.</p>
<h1>General Overview</h1>
<p>Overall this headset is not worth the money. The sound quality is mediocre, borderline bad microphone, active noise canceling, and USB wired audio. This headset at the budget price at Newegg for 130$ is extremely overpriced. I believe this headset should be more valued at 30-50$ but it is marked up over twice as much as it&#8217;s actual value.<br />
