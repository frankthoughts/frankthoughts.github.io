										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Soylent After a Month is quite an experience. This post is to review my time with only using Soylent over the course of a month. I was using a mixture of bagged Soylent and premixed. This was while the bagged Soylent was on V1.7.<br />
In addition to this, I&#8217;d like to note that purchasing Soylent straight from the website is cheaper than buying it on Amazon. I highly suggest going to Soylent.com in order to purchase your product.<br />
If you use my referral link below, you can get the first order of 12 soylent bottles for 50% off! It&#8217;s worth trying for 50% off. In addition to that, they will donate 1$ to world hunger :<br />
<a href="http://r.soy.lt/jUm8Z">http://r.soy.lt/jUm8Z</a></p>
<h2>Inventory</h2>
<p><em>Ordered 12/15/16 from <a href="https://soylent.com/">www.soylent.com</a></em></p>
<ul>
<li>6 x 12 Soylent Originals (72 bottles or 14.4 days of original)</li>
<li>3 x 12 Coffiest Soylent (C1-00CFE) (36 bottles or 7.2 days of Coffiest)</li>
<li>9 Bags of Soylent (9 Days)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pros</h2>
<p>Convenience, Speed, Don&#8217;t have to cook or order out, No need to wonder what to eat next, time-saving</p>
<h2>Cons</h2>
<p>Price, Taste, Makes you feel like a robot, off-putting at first drinking only Soylent, No chewing/eating food makes your jaws lose strength, not being able to eat with others</p>
<h2>A Summary of my Experience</h2>
<p>At first, it&#8217;s a bit scary drinking only liquid over the course of 30 days. Because it&#8217;s so different you really have to get used to drinking the soylent mentally. Physically, it&#8217;s actually quite nice since you don&#8217;t have to figure out what you want to eat, cook it, go out to buy the food/ingredients, and etc&#8230;<br />
The convenience of soylent is amazing. Simply order a month of Soylent, it gets delivered to your house. Then you&#8217;re done, you have a month supply of food in your living room. If you&#8217;re hungry all you have to do is walk over and grab a bottle. It&#8217;s sort of like the convenience factor of having to wear a uniform to school. You never really have to worry about what to wear, all you have to do is get your uniform and go. It simplifies things, and I really didn&#8217;t even miss eating food. It truly is a game changer and opens up your life to do so many more things with that saved time.<br />
That being said, you have to get adjusted to drinking only liquid for food. Only consuming liquid for sustenance can be really off-putting at first. Honestly, after a while, you&#8217;ll start to feel like a robot getting your daily gas for the day. But Soylent really changes things. Since you are consuming the optimal amount of calories/nutrients, you don&#8217;t overeat or undereat anymore. You don&#8217;t have to worry about whether you are getting all your nutrients as long as you&#8217;re consuming your five bottles of Soylent a day.<br />
An interesting side effect of only drinking soylent was that my jaws started to feel sore after I talked for too long. I didn&#8217;t really notice this at first but I realized because I wasn&#8217;t chewing food anymore I wasn&#8217;t really using my jaws much anymore. This might have been a placebo, but I had to start chewing a bit of gum to fight off the soreness and recessed jaw muscles.<br />
Another issue with Soylent that some people have is that they aren&#8217;t able to eat food with other people. Personally, it wasn&#8217;t a super big deal. I don&#8217;t mind sitting with others drinking water or something, to be honest. It&#8217;s not an awkward experience for me at all, most of the time people are on their phones anyways at some point in time, so I&#8217;d just scroll through Reddit or try to do something more productive with my time.</p>
<h2>Key Experience</h2>
<p>An extremely important experience regarding my bottled soylent experience was that I felt the best I had ever felt IN MY LIFE. I used to feel bloated or uncomfortable if I ate something bad. But I never felt bloated while on Soylent. Also, when you&#8217;re hungry it&#8217;s very easy to resolve the hunger quickly. All you would have to do is go to the soylent storage and grab a bottle and then, you&#8217;re not hungry anymore. I lost some weight, and I felt super light. I truly loved drinking Soylent because of this, and I was playing a lot of League of Legends during this time, so I could easily drink my meal between loading screens.<br />
I felt so efficient, however, when you are continuously playing league of legends on hours, you get this special type of fatigue that I personally had never experienced before. Usually, you will have to take a break to eat food, but I never took a break. So I just kept going, and this made me so tired! It was a very interesting experience for me as I had never felt this kind of fatigue before! Even two years later, I remember this fatigue like yesterday and it truly was an experience to be had.</p>
<h2>Bottled Soylent vs Packaged Powder Soylent</h2>
<p>The bottled soylent was MUCH MUCH better than the packaged powder soylent. Honestly, the powdered soylent was NOT convenient, mixing Soylent at V1.7 was extremely bad. The powder didn&#8217;t mix well with water and you really needed a blender to properly mix the soylent. not to mention, you have to clean the bottles. And if you didn&#8217;t clean the bottles IMMEDIATELY, the bottles will start to smell horrific. I have no idea what that smell was but it got so bad, I had to start cleaning everything immediately after mixing the soylent up.<br />
That being said, the bottled soylent was great. I personally really enjoyed the taste. It was like a slight vanilla flavored taste of Soylent and I honestly liked it. The powder soylent, no matter what I did, never would taste close to what the bottled tasted like. I tried multiple levels of mixture, but there was no way it would taste like whatever they do for the bottled soylent.</p>
<h2>Overall</h2>
<p>I would highly suggest trying Soylent if you haven&#8217;t. I personally would have continued to drink bottled Soylent if it wasn&#8217;t so expensive. I have gone back to regular food but sometime substitute some breakfasts with Coffiest because of how convenient it is. But purchasing foods is actually cheaper than Soylent, so it&#8217;s hard to justify actually drinking Soylent 5 times a day. I hope that they are able to drive the price down, and one day it&#8217;ll be cheaper to actually drink Soylent than to buy food. I&#8217;ll be for sure one of the guys who makes the switch ASAP once it&#8217;s reached that inflection point as I did truly enjoy my experience drinking Soylent.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This is an easy 10 minute Microwave Breakfast for under 2$ that you can cook at the office. This is a great quick microwave breakfast in the office.<br />
I like to minimize my time with breakfast but cereal, muffins, and other quick fixes are unhealthy, expensive, and leave an over processed taste in my mouth over time. So I&#8217;ve evolved my breakfast routine to some healthier foods and for cost efficiency and time I have made it so that it takes about 5 minutes of actual work to get a healthy tasty meal at work.<br />
I utilize a modified version of the Tim Ferriss, back when he seemed a bit more awkward on camera.<br />
Linked to it is below,<br />
<iframe title="How to Make A Healthy Breakfast In Under 3 Minutes" width="1080" height="608" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fd-7a_wdVZk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
Unfortunately it&#8217;s not very easy to find this recipe in text form, so I had to watch the whole video. I know I&#8217;d rather read compressed material than watch a video and try to extract the information.<br />
Nonetheless he had some great ideas obviously and now is kicking it with famous people on his new podcast. I&#8217;m going to spare you the 6 minutes and give you a quick run down of the recipe.</p>
<h1>Quick Microwave Breakfast in the Office</h1>
<h2><strong>Hardware Requirements (Initial cost of ~$20-40)</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Microwave (20$ for a cheap microwave at in store at Kroger, I&#8217;ve noticed that online ones are quite expensive a quick search got a cheap 23$ one at a Sears outlet, and 36$ for a Hamilton beach at walmart)</li>
<li>Microwavable Container (5-10$ one time purchase)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Time Cost: About 10-20 minutes searching online. 30-50 minutes going into store to purchase one.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Material Requirements ($2.33 &#8211; $4.00)</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Liquid Egg Whites ($3.50 for about 16oz, I use about $0.50~$0.80 cents worth of it each time)</li>
<li>Salsa  [you can pick whichever salsa, keep it in context of a meal of egg whites and other breakfasts my favorite is mango salsa which funnily sounds horrible on chips] (~$3.00 for ~16oz, and I use about 1/6 ea time so about $0.5)</li>
<li>Frozen Chopped Spinach (I buy mine at Whole Foods for $2.00, and I use about 1/5 the container each time so about $0.40)</li>
<li>Salt and Pepper (free~1$)</li>
<li>Frozen fruit or Fresh fruit depending on your budget, location, and convenience ($1-4, I like to buy a decently size box of sliced mango at El Ranchero for about $3.00 for convenience. I eat about 1/3 of it so I&#8217;m pricing this at $1 personally. But you could easily buy cheaper fruit some healthy cheap fruits are listed <a href="https://greatist.com/health/44-healthy-foods-under-1">here</a> the cheapest being grapes and oranges for about $0.5 each)</li>
<li>Coffee/Tea (free ~$0.33-$1.00)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Time Cost : 5-10minutes of cooking and prep time.</strong><br />
<em>Nice to haves : Salsa con Queso to put on your spinach ($3.00 it makes it super good)</em><br />
&nbsp;<br />
So for about 2-3$ for each breakfast and about 10-15 minutes you can get a large filling healthy breakfast at work. Most work places have Microwaves so this is really most convenient if you already have one. Once you have these items together below are the steps I follow:</p>
<h1>Directions</h1>
<p>I use a 12 oz cup and pour half to 3/4 of the cup of liquid egg whites. Then I put the cup into the microwave for 2 minutes and 30 seconds.<br />
During the time it&#8217;s cooking I pour some frozen spinach into another 12oz cup and then follow the directions and pour a bit of water onto the frozen spinach. I pour about enough to fill up the 12oz cup as it will thaw and fill up half the cup once cooked.<br />
Once finished, the egg whites should be cooked; take it out, and put the frozen spinach into the Microwave. Then microwave the frozen spinach for about 1.5 minutes.<br />
While the frozen spinach is cooking, I put my egg whites onto a paper plate, throw some salt and pepper on it, and then pour my salsa over the egg whites.<br />
Once the frozen spinach has microwaved for 1.5 minutes, take it out, pour out the water, and then put it back into the Microwave for 2 minutes.<br />
At this point I&#8217;ll get the fruit ready, you will need to microwave respectively the frozen fruit you have. I personally love my sliced mango and I can just take it out and put it next to my egg whites.<br />
Once the Spinach is finished cooking, I put it out on my plate. If you have decided to go down the salsa con queso route, you&#8217;ll have to microwave the salsa con queso for about 0:15-0:30 seconds and then pour it on your spinach. (You won&#8217;t regret it)<br />
I also have coffee or tea with my breakfast, luckily I have free coffee and tea and just grab some.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>I&#8217;m also lucky and where I work they have disposable paper cups and plates that I can microwave stuff in so I personally use that stuff and throw it all out once I&#8217;m done making it so that I don&#8217;t have to clean anything.<br />
You can use microwavable plastic, but personally I would not microwave stuff in plastic. I believe there is no proof saying that microwaving plastic will cause cancer but practice at your own risk.<br />
Thank you for reading my blog, please comment below on what you would like to read and I&#8217;ll try to indulge. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />
