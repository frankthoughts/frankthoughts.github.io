					<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Soylent After a Month is quite an experience. This post is to review my time with only using Soylent over the course of a month. I was using a mixture of bagged Soylent and premixed. This was while the bagged Soylent was on V1.7.<br>
In addition to this, I’d like to note that purchasing Soylent straight from the website is cheaper than buying it on Amazon. I highly suggest going to Soylent.com in order to purchase your product.<br>
If you use my referral link below, you can get the first order of 12 soylent bottles for 50% off! It’s worth trying for 50% off. In addition to that, they will donate 1$ to world hunger :<br><a href="http://r.soy.lt/jUm8Z">http://r.soy.lt/jUm8Z</a></p>
<h2>Inventory</h2>
<p><em>Ordered 12/15/16 from <a href="https://soylent.com/">www.soylent.com</a></em></p>
<ul><li>6 x 12 Soylent Originals (72 bottles or 14.4 days of original)</li>
<li>3 x 12 Coffiest Soylent (C1-00CFE) (36 bottles or 7.2 days of Coffiest)</li>
<li>9 Bags of Soylent (9 Days)</li>
</ul><h2>Pros</h2>
<p>Convenience, Speed, Don’t have to cook or order out, No need to wonder what to eat next, time-saving</p>
<h2>Cons</h2>
<p>Price, Taste, Makes you feel like a robot, off-putting at first drinking only Soylent, No chewing/eating food makes your jaws lose strength, not being able to eat with others</p>
<h2>A Summary of my Experience</h2>
<p>At first, it’s a bit scary drinking only liquid over the course of 30 days. Because it’s so different you really have to get used to drinking the soylent mentally. Physically, it’s actually quite nice since you don’t have to figure out what you want to eat, cook it, go out to buy the food/ingredients, and etc…<br>
The convenience of soylent is amazing. Simply order a month of Soylent, it gets delivered to your house. Then you’re done, you have a month supply of food in your living room. If you’re hungry all you have to do is walk over and grab a bottle. It’s sort of like the convenience factor of having to wear a uniform to school. You never really have to worry about what to wear, all you have to do is get your uniform and go. It simplifies things, and I really didn’t even miss eating food. It truly is a game changer and opens up your life to do so many more things with that saved time.<br>
That being said, you have to get adjusted to drinking only liquid for food. Only consuming liquid for sustenance can be really off-putting at first. Honestly, after a while, you’ll start to feel like a robot getting your daily gas for the day. But Soylent really changes things. Since you are consuming the optimal amount of calories/nutrients, you don’t overeat or undereat anymore. You don’t have to worry about whether you are getting all your nutrients as long as you’re consuming your five bottles of Soylent a day.<br>
An interesting side effect of only drinking soylent was that my jaws started to feel sore after I talked for too long. I didn’t really notice this at first but I realized because I wasn’t chewing food anymore I wasn’t really using my jaws much anymore. This might have been a placebo, but I had to start chewing a bit of gum to fight off the soreness and recessed jaw muscles.<br>
Another issue with Soylent that some people have is that they aren’t able to eat food with other people. Personally, it wasn’t a super big deal. I don’t mind sitting with others drinking water or something, to be honest. It’s not an awkward experience for me at all, most of the time people are on their phones anyways at some point in time, so I’d just scroll through Reddit or try to do something more productive with my time.</p>
<h2>Key Experience</h2>
<p>An extremely important experience regarding my bottled soylent experience was that I felt the best I had ever felt IN MY LIFE. I used to feel bloated or uncomfortable if I ate something bad. But I never felt bloated while on Soylent. Also, when you’re hungry it’s very easy to resolve the hunger quickly. All you would have to do is go to the soylent storage and grab a bottle and then, you’re not hungry anymore. I lost some weight, and I felt super light. I truly loved drinking Soylent because of this, and I was playing a lot of League of Legends during this time, so I could easily drink my meal between loading screens.<br>
I felt so efficient, however, when you are continuously playing league of legends on hours, you get this special type of fatigue that I personally had never experienced before. Usually, you will have to take a break to eat food, but I never took a break. So I just kept going, and this made me so tired! It was a very interesting experience for me as I had never felt this kind of fatigue before! Even two years later, I remember this fatigue like yesterday and it truly was an experience to be had.</p>
<h2>Bottled Soylent vs Packaged Powder Soylent</h2>
<p>The bottled soylent was MUCH MUCH better than the packaged powder soylent. Honestly, the powdered soylent was NOT convenient, mixing Soylent at V1.7 was extremely bad. The powder didn’t mix well with water and you really needed a blender to properly mix the soylent. not to mention, you have to clean the bottles. And if you didn’t clean the bottles IMMEDIATELY, the bottles will start to smell horrific. I have no idea what that smell was but it got so bad, I had to start cleaning everything immediately after mixing the soylent up.<br>
That being said, the bottled soylent was great. I personally really enjoyed the taste. It was like a slight vanilla flavored taste of Soylent and I honestly liked it. The powder soylent, no matter what I did, never would taste close to what the bottled tasted like. I tried multiple levels of mixture, but there was no way it would taste like whatever they do for the bottled soylent.</p>
<h2>Overall</h2>
<p>I would highly suggest trying Soylent if you haven’t. I personally would have continued to drink bottled Soylent if it wasn’t so expensive. I have gone back to regular food but sometime substitute some breakfasts with Coffiest because of how convenient it is. But purchasing foods is actually cheaper than Soylent, so it’s hard to justify actually drinking Soylent 5 times a day. I hope that they are able to drive the price down, and one day it’ll be cheaper to actually drink Soylent than to buy food. I’ll be for sure one of the guys who makes the switch ASAP once it’s reached that inflection point as I did truly enjoy my experience drinking Soylent.<br>
